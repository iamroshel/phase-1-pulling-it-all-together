# Pulling It All Together c

## Learning Goals

- Review the Three Pillars
- Prepare to code the example

## Introduction

We've come a long way since we first took a look at Simple Liker. Remember our
social media app that lets us "favorite" a post?

We took a close look at all of the components that make an action like that
possible on the web. Now, it's time to review them and get ready to build our
own.

## Review the Three Pillars

We broke down the web programming concepts we're working with into Three
Pillars. We've returned to those throughout our journey, so by now they're
probably pretty familiar:

1. Manipulating the DOM
2. Recognizing JavaScript events
3. Communicating with the server

We practiced each step and dug into the JavaScript basics necessary to program
each. With this experience, we can now pull the concepts and the practice
together.

## Prepare to Code the Example

In the next lab, you'll have the opportunity to create your own Simple Liker
from scratch. As you work through it, remember to take a step back whenever
necessary to keep perspective on the whole process and each pillar's place
within it.

## Conclusion

With a solid grasp of all Three Pillars of web programming and how to implement
them, we're prepared to code our own working web apps.
